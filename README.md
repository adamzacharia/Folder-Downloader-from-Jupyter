# Folder-Downloader-from-Jupyter
Folder Zipper This Python script allows you to zip a folder using the zipfile module in Python. It provides a simple function zip_folder() which takes the path of the folder to be zipped and the desired path for the resulting zip file. The script recursively zips all files and subfolders within the specified folder.
